# 📘 Maplewood Academic Scheduling System

## 🚀 Overview

The **Maplewood Academic Scheduling System** is a full‑stack platform designed to modernize academic scheduling, automate course/teacher/classroom assignments, and provide student‑friendly tools for enrollment and progress tracking.

This project includes:

* A **Spring Boot backend** responsible for schedule generation, enrollment logic, transcript building, academic progress analysis, and resource utilization (teacher/room).
* A **React + TypeScript frontend**, providing interfaces for administrators, teachers, and students.

This document serves as the technical overview of the system, derived from backend and frontend documentation.

# 🏗️ System Architecture

## 🔧 Backend Architecture (Spring Boot)

The backend follows a **layered architecture**:

* **Controller Layer** – REST API endpoints
* **Service Layer** – Business logic (scheduling, enrollment, progress, transcripts)
* **Repository Layer** – DB interaction via Spring Data JPA
* **Persistence Layer** – SQLite relational database

### 📁 Backend Folder Structure

* `config/` – CORS, Swagger, initial setup
* `controller/` – API controllers
* `dto/` – Request/response objects
* `entity/` – JPA entities
* `repository/` – Database interaction layer
* `service/` – Core business services
* `exception/` – Custom exceptions
* `resources/` – App configs


## 🎨 Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)

* **React Functional Components + Hooks**
* **React Router** for navigation
* **API abstraction layer** (`api.ts`)
* **Reusable UI components** (Button, Input, Card, PageHeader, Timetable)
* **Role-based rendering** (Admin / Teacher / Student)

# 🗄️ Database Summary

The system uses an SQLite database containing:

* Classrooms & Room Types
* Courses & Course Sections
* Section Meetings
* Semesters & Specializations
* Students & Teachers
* Student Course History
* Enrollments & Grades

An ERD diagram (System Design folder) visualizes relationships among these entities.

# 🧩✨ System Design Principles, Patterns & Algorithms (Fun + Friendly Edition!)

Welcome to the *brain* of the Maplewood Scheduling System! 🧠⚙️
Here’s a fun, emoji-filled breakdown of how the system thinks, plans, validates, and automates your academic world. 🎓💡

## 🎯 Design Principles (The "Rules We Live By")

* **🎈 Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** – Every service does *one thing amazingly well*.
* **🧩 Separation of Concerns** – Keep things tidy! Each layer has its own job.
* **🪄 Dependency Injection** – Magic wiring so everything stays flexible.
* **🛡️ Transactional Integrity** – All-or-nothing safety net.
* **🚦 Fail‑Fast Validation** – Stop bad actions before they cause trouble.
* **🔁 DRY** – No copy‑paste madness; reuse is king.

## 🏛️ Design Patterns (Our System’s Secret Superpowers)

* **📦 Service Layer Pattern** – Business logic stays clean and organized.
* **📚 Repository Pattern** – Easy, safe database access.
* **🔀 Mapper Pattern** – Converts database entities → friendly DTOs.
* **✔️ Validation Pattern** – A pipeline of checks to keep data clean.
* **🌀 Recursive Pattern** – Perfect for prerequisite chains.
* **📊 Aggregator Pattern** – Rolls up stats for teachers & rooms.
* **🧠 Strategy‑like Delegation** – Smart assignment selection.
* **📅 Comparator Pattern** – Weekday sorting like a pro.

## 🧮 Algorithms (How the System "Thinks")

### 🕒 Scheduling Algorithms (ScheduleGeneratorService)

* **🔁 Course Scheduling Loop** – Builds sections one by one.
* **🧠 Constraint‑based Assignment** – Picks the best teacher & room.
* **⚡ Greedy Time Scheduling** – Finds the earliest valid time.
* **📅 Sorting Algorithm** – Keeps meetings in clean weekday order.
* **📦 Grouping** – Organizes sections by course.

### 📝 Enrollment Algorithms (EnrollmentService)

* **🚦 Validation Pipeline** – Every rule checked step‑by‑step.
* **🌀 Recursive Prerequisite Checker** – Deep prerequisite verification.
* **⏱️ Conflict Detection** – No double‑booking allowed!
* **🎯 Smart Section Selector** – Chooses the best available seat.

### 🔍 Eligibility Algorithms (EligibilityService)

* **🚫 Fail‑Fast Filters** – Quickly remove invalid options.
* **🕒 Conflict Detection** – Finds overlapping meetings.
* **📏 Capacity Checks** – Makes sure there’s room.

### 📅 Schedule Rendering Algorithms (ScheduleService)

* **🔍 Enrollment Lookup** – Finds all sections per student.
* **🎨 DTO Mapping** – Builds clean schedule items.
* **📊 Capacity Calculator** – Remaining seats count.

### 🎓 Academic Progress Algorithms (AcademicProgressService)

* **🎯 Credit Summation** – Earned vs. needed credits.
* **📘 GPA Calculation** – Weighted score math.
* **📚 Core Completion** – Tracks mandatory course progress.
* **🗓️ Graduation Projection** – Estimates time left.

### 📜 Transcript Algorithms (AcademicTranscriptService)

* **📂 History Iteration** – Loops through all course history.
* **🧾 Mapping** – Formats transcript rows.
* **🏷️ Semester Labeling** – Pretty names like “Fall 2024”.

### 🏫 Resource Utilization Algorithms (ResourceUtilizationService)

* **⏳ Weekly Hours Calculation** – Sum of teaching/room hours.
* **📅 Daily Load** – Workload per weekday.
* **📈 Usage Percentage** – Utilization math.
* **⚠️ Conflict Detection** – Finds overlapping assignments.
* **📦 Grouping** – Organizes by teacher or room.
